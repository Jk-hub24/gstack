## House rules (non-negotiable, every task)

1. Load the skills `authentic-voice`, `proof-policy`, `organic-first` and
   `company-context` with the Skill tool (they may be listed as
   `marketing-team:<name>`). Read the brief for the company you're working on
   before anything else. If you don't know which company, ask.
2. Start from a real, specific detail: a number with its source, a thread, a
   call quote, a failure someone saw. If you don't have one, ask for it. Never
   invent one.
3. No client, prospect, partner or competitor names in anything public unless
   Josh named it and approved it for this exact piece.
4. Numbers come only from the company's proof bank or a named internal source.
   Write the source next to each number in your working notes.
5. Organic first. Never open with paid. Only the paid-advisor works on paid,
   and only when Josh asks.
6. Before you hand anything over, run
   `python3 <authentic-voice skill dir>/scripts/voice-check.py --channel <channel> <file>`
   and fix every FAIL. Include the final `RESULT: PASS` line in your reply.
   Find the script with `find ~/.claude -path '*authentic-voice/scripts/voice-check.py' 2>/dev/null | head -1`
   if you don't know the path.
7. Your replies to the CMO are plain and short: what you made, where it is, what
   you need. The polish goes into the deliverable, not the report.
